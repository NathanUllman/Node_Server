A nice little Node.js server that runs a website (locatated in the 'website' folder)
note that the server depends on and uses the file structure of the website folder kind of like ASP.NET

still a work in progress, but was a fun learning experience

chat server is a little test of websockets


**How to run from server folder**

npm install

npx ts-node deploy.ts

-- will then be at http://localhost:8080/
